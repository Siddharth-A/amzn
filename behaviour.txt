- for each project at AMD, we do something called a bringup. in bringup, the goal of the organization is to 
complete verification of all sanity tests and verify as much as you can as fast as you can because the aim is to 
give the fab a thumbs up and say yes this chip is how we designed it to be. 
- for each bringup, every team has their own bringup goals which is set of basic requirements set by verification 
team

S: the display verification team during the bringup of one of the navi projects had a high turnover rate. as a result,
   i was dealing with someone who was relatively new to the hardware. he set some requirements which were not enough

T: my task as project lead was to gain the verification teams sign-off on the bringup goals

A: setup a meeting with the project manager, my manager, ver eng and his manager. cited examples of previous projects
   came to middle ground for expectations

R: was able to achieve bringup exit within the alloted time line and achieve the team goals

**********
GM is an aggresively growing company with an alomst 40% increase in its second quarter and 19% in firs quarter.
and it was announced as 2020 full size pickup sales leaders due to some of the most sold suvs like
tahoe, suburban, yukon and escalade. 

along with the existing line up of automobiles, its making strides in the ev and av market with its 
partnership with cruise which is currently testing autonomous driving on streets of san francisco 
and also microsoft earlier this year.  

and lastly i was impressed with factory zero which is also in line for zero crashes zero emissions and 
will serve as the hq for all electric vehicles in future. so with all these reasons in mind, i would love 
to join gm 

**********************************************************************************
* tell me about a time you had to quickly change work priorities to meet demand? *
**********************************************************************************
in my current role, i am the assigned point of contact for all dGPU projects. with each new release of projects,
there comes different versions of the project to denote different form factors and capabilities. 

S: a lot of the times, a new version to an exisiting project is released and based on the hw, display has some 
   type of issue with the eligibility of tests which can run on it

T: the task, as north america lead is to try and resolve issue before next business day if it is a priority 1

A: i communicate the ticket to my manager via email and mention that depending on complexity of the issue, i may not 
   be able to meet my business goals for this week 

R: most of the times, I am able to resolve the goals within 1-2 days so they dont gain high visibility. have also 
   created a tool called DRA which when you input the version of project should display the test cases which are valid. 

***************************************************************************************
* tell me about a time you recieved negative feedback from manager and your response? *
***************************************************************************************
in celestica, one of the responsibilities of my role as a test development engineer was procurement of off the shelf hardware.
had to work multiple vendors and ensure the product came in in a timely manner for all porjects. 

due to the ever changing nature of the project and because some items had to be tested before integration, some items had to be 
sent back and replacement had to be procured as well. 

based on my performance, i recieved a negative feedback from my manager citing that the procurement of items and return of unused 
hardware was not up to the mark. 

in order to improve on this, i decided to create a master excel sheet and logged in the item placed on order, tracking and date when it 
was placed on order. in the end issue was not that the procurement was taking longer, the issue was that i was not able to keep up with 
the communication with my manager on the status of materials and creating the excel sheet helped over come that and i recieved a pat on
my back for my efforts

**************************************************
* Your greatest accomplishment in your work life *
**************************************************
S: test passing individually but when run as part of system level test, it would fail intermittently. 5/100 times

T: i along with a senior engineer were tasked with debugging the process

A: first things first, i tried to find the root cause of the problem by checking regression results by leaving a platform running
   overnight with tests. this brought us to a commit which changed how the dmub fw accesses the frame buffer. part of mem used by 
   the failing test to verify pattern mismatch

R: based on info above, was able to successfully triage to the correct team and ask for support for a fix on this problem
